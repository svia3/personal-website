								<p>Glad you could make it. My name is Stephen. I am from Silver Spring, MD
									but have been living in Atlanta, GA for the past couple of years as I attend university. I am a senior Computer Engineering student at the
									Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a minor in Computing and Intelligence.
								<p> I am a programmer and a writer,
								but most importantly, someone who likes to think outloud, someone who is a tireless seeker of wisdom. I enjoy reading philosophy, listening to audio books and podcasts,
								playing video games, fitness, photography, and running around Atlanta looking for adventure. At this point in my life, I not only expect to challenge myself in the way I
								carry myself each day, I welcome it. I hope you enjoy your stay here. Maybe you'll learn a thing or too.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/coding+graphic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Most of the projects that I have worked on have been through school. Below are some of relavent courses that I have taken here at Tech
								accompanied by some projects that I thought you would like. Most of these classes were through my ECE, Electrical and Computer Engineering, curriculum,
								but some of my Computer Science classes made the cut. You can always check out my <a href="https://github.com/svia3">github</a> if you
							 	want any specifics. </p>
								<h3 class="major">ECE 3056: Architecture, Concurrency, and Energy</h3>
								<h4> Cache and VM Simulator </h4>
								<p> This class was all about memory management and cpu modeling. It really helped me develop an appreciation for all of the work that compilers, registers, and
								datapaths do in the processes that make up computing power. This project had two main goals:</p>
								<ul>
									<li> simulate a single level, N-way set associative cache for a given block size, using LRU replacement</li>
									<li> simulate the paging system of an OS Kernel by performing a single process with a page table and TLB</li>
								</ul>
								<h4> VHDL MIPS Pipeline  </h4>
								<p>VHDL stands for "VHSIC Hardware Description Language." VHSIC is yet another achronym which stands for "Very High Speed Integrated Circuits." It is important because it can model the hardware interactions of a processor. MIPS is a 32-bit, reduced-instruction set architecture that many processors nowadays utilize.
									Basically, this project was aimed at students attempting to make their own pipeline model in VHDL that implemented data-forwarding, and supported load-to-use stalls and control hazards.
									Nerdy stuff, I know. Here's kinda what this whole datapath looks like on a MIPS processor:</p>
